## Usage
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is an intelligent flashcard program frequently used by medical students. <br>
[AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/) was created as a way to add flashcards and add-ons to Anki, making it even more powerful.

UWorld Batch Unsuspend exists as an add-on to Anki through AnkiWeb. <br>
You can access this add-on on the [AnkiWeb add-on website](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons).<br>
Directions to add it to your anki instance can be found there.

## Contribute
I don't plan on extending this to tags outside UWorld. The point is to make tag searching as easy as possible. Once you start introducing typing in full tags, you lose the power of this tool.

But if you have any ideas or bugs, feel free to raise a new issue in our Issues tab! :)

And if you're inclined to do so, feel free to create any new PRs with changes and I can take a look.

## Thanks :)

If you found this helpful, I'd appreciate a quick rating on AnkiWeb or a Star on Github.
